# Hello!
## I am a Computer Scientist and Game Developer. Currently proficient in Java, Rust, Lua, Python

# What I do?

- Full-stack Game Developer: love to create games in my free time

- Game Designer: love to create concepts and structure projects

- Compiler designer: one of my favorite field of study in Computer Science happens to be this one! Currently designing a scripting-language hosted off of Rust inspired by the design of Lua and it's register-based virtual machine

- Code-Reviewer: Professionally been reviewing Lua code for 2+ years, reviewing design, performance, quality, etc

- Researcher: Currently writing a research paper/article on the design of choice on virtual-machine architectures between Registers and Stacks and translating the stack-based JVM to a register-based machine to highlight the efficiency

- Computer Science Teacher: Teach Game Development concepts such as optimizations, writing better code for games, physics and Linear-Algebra for games while also teaching Computer Science such as Data-Structures and Algorithms, Computational-Analysis, Code-Design, Compiler-Design, CPU-Design and Architecture, Memory hierarchy. Currently teaching to 15 students for 2 years
